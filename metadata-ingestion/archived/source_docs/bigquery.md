# BigQuery

To get all metadata from BigQuery you need to use two plugins `bigquery` and `bigquery-usage`. Both of them are described in this page. These will require 2 separate recipes. We understand this is not ideal and we plan to make this easier in the future.

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## `bigquery`
### Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[bigquery]'`.

### Prerequisites
#### Create a datahub profile in GCP
1. Create a custom role for datahub as per [BigQuery docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#creating_a_custom_role)
2. Grant the following permissions to this role:
```   
   bigquery.datasets.get
   bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy
   bigquery.jobs.create
   bigquery.jobs.list
   bigquery.jobs.listAll
   bigquery.models.getMetadata
   bigquery.models.list
   bigquery.routines.get
   bigquery.routines.list
   bigquery.tables.create # Needs for profiling
   bigquery.tables.get
   bigquery.tables.getData # Needs for profiling
   bigquery.tables.list
   # needed for lineage generation via GCP logging
   logging.logEntries.list
   logging.privateLogEntries.list
   resourcemanager.projects.get
```
#### Create a service account

1. Setup a ServiceAccount as per [BigQuery docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#iam-service-accounts-create-console)
and assign the previously created role to this service account.
2. Download a service account JSON keyfile.
   Example credential file:
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "project-id-1234567",
  "private_key_id": "d0121d0000882411234e11166c6aaa23ed5d74e0",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIyourkey\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "client_email": "test@suppproject-id-1234567.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "113545814931671546333",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/test%suppproject-id-1234567.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```
3. To provide credentials to the source, you can either:
   Set an environment variable:
       $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/keyfile.json"

   *or*

   Set credential config in your source based on the credential json file. For example: 

```yml
     credential:
       project_id: project-id-1234567
       private_key_id: "d0121d0000882411234e11166c6aaa23ed5d74e0"
       private_key: "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIyourkey\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
       client_email: "test@suppproject-id-1234567.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
       client_id: "123456678890"
```

### Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, and tables
- Column types associated with each table
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional [SQL profiling](./sql_profiles.md)
- Table level lineage.

You can also get fine-grained usage statistics for BigQuery using the `bigquery-usage` source described [below](#bigquery-usage-plugin).

### Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: bigquery
  config:
    # Coordinates
    project_id: my_project_id

    # `schema_pattern` for BQ Datasets
    schema_pattern:
      allow:
        - finance_bq_dataset

    table_pattern:
      deny:
        # The exact name of the table is revenue_table_name
        # The reason we have this `.*` at the beginning is because the current implmenetation of table_pattern is testing
        # project_id.dataset_name.table_name
        # We will improve this in the future
        - .*revenue_table_name

sink:
  # sink configs
```

### Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

As a SQL-based service, the Athena integration is also supported by our SQL profiler. See [here](./sql_profiles.md) for more details on configuration.

The following parameters are only relevant if include_table_lineage is set to true:

- max_query_duration 
- start_time 
- end_time 
- extra_client_options

When `use_exported_bigquery_audit_metadata` is set to `true`, lineage information will be computed using exported bigquery logs. On how to setup exported bigquery audit logs, refer to the following [docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/auditlogs#defining_a_bigquery_log_sink_using_gcloud) on BigQuery audit logs. Note that only protoPayloads with "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.BigQueryAuditMetadata" are supported by the current ingestion version. The `bigquery_audit_metadata_datasets` parameter will be used only if `use_exported_bigquery_audit_metadat` is set to `true`.

Note: the `bigquery_audit_metadata_datasets` parameter receives a list of datasets, in the format $PROJECT.$DATASET. This way queries from a multiple number of projects can be used to compute lineage information.

Note: Since bigquery source also supports dataset level lineage, the auth client will require additional permissions to be able to access the google audit logs. Refer the permissions section in bigquery-usage section below which also accesses the audit logs.

### Profiling
Profiling can profile normal/partitioned and sharded tables as well but due to performance reasons, we only profile the latest partition for Partitioned tables and the latest shard for sharded tables.

If limit/offset parameter is set or partitioning partitioned or sharded table Great Expectation (the profiling framework we use) needs to create temporary
views. By default these views are created in the schema where the profiled table is but you can control to create all these
tables into a predefined schema by setting `profiling.bigquery_temp_table_schema` property. 
Temporary tables are removed after profiling.

```yaml
     profiling:
       enabled: true
       bigquery_temp_table_schema: my-project-id.my-schema-where-views-can-be-created
```

:::note

Due to performance reasons, we only profile the latest partition for Partitioned tables and the latest shard for sharded tables.
You can set partition explicitly with `partition.partition_datetime` property if you want. (partition will be applied to all partitioned tables)

## `bigquery-usage`

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

### Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[bigquery-usage]'`.

### Prerequisites

The Google Identity must have one of the following OAuth scopes granted to it: 

- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.read
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.admin
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform

And should be authorized on all projects you'd like to ingest usage stats from. 

### Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Statistics on queries issued and tables and columns accessed (excludes views)
- Aggregation of these statistics into buckets, by day or hour granularity

:::note

1. This source only does usage statistics. To get the tables, views, and schemas in your BigQuery project, use the `bigquery` source described above.
2. Depending on the compliance policies setup for the bigquery instance, sometimes logging.read permission is not sufficient. In that case, use either admin or private log viewer permission.

### Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: bigquery-usage
  config:
    # Coordinates
    projects:
      - project_id_1
      - project_id_2

    # Options
    top_n_queries: 10
    dataset_pattern:
      allow:
        - marketing_db
        - sales_db
    table_pattern:
      deny:
        - .*feedback.*
        - .*salary.*

sink:
  # sink configs
```

### Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

By default, we extract usage stats for the last day, with the recommendation that this source is executed every day.
