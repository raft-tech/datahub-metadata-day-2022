# Feast

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

This source is designed for Feast 10+ repositories.

As of version 0.10+, Feast has changed the architecture from a stack of services to SDK/CLI centric application. Please refer to [Feast 0.9 vs Feast 0.10+](https://docs.feast.dev/project/feast-0.9-vs-feast-0.10+) for further details.

For compatibility with pre-0.10 Feast, see [Feast Legacy](feast_legacy.md) source.

:::note

This source is only compatible with Feast 0.18.0
