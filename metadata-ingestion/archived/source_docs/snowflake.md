# Snowflake

To get all metadata from Snowflake you need to use two plugins `snowflake` and `snowflake-usage`. Both of them are described in this page. These will require 2 separate recipes. We understand this is not ideal and we plan to make this easier in the future.

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## `snowflake`
### Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[snowflake]'`.

### Prerequisites

In order to execute this source, your Snowflake user will need to have specific privileges granted to it for reading metadata
from your warehouse. 

You can use the `provision_role` block in the recipe to grant the requires roles. 

If your system admins prefer running the commands themselves then they can follow this guide to create a DataHub-specific role, assign it the required privileges, and assign it to a new DataHub user by executing the following Snowflake commands from a user with the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or `MANAGE GRANTS` privilege.

```sql
create or replace role datahub_role;

// Grant access to a warehouse to run queries to view metadata
grant operate, usage on warehouse "<your-warehouse>" to role datahub_role;

// Grant access to view database and schema in which your tables/views exist
grant usage on DATABASE "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant usage on all schemas in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant usage on future schemas in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;

// If you are NOT using Snowflake Profiling feature: Grant references privileges to your tables and views 
grant references on all tables in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant references on future tables in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant references on all external tables in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant references on future external tables in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant references on all views in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant references on future views in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;

// If you ARE using Snowflake Profiling feature: Grant select privileges to your tables and views 
grant select on all tables in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant select on future tables in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant select on all external tables in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant select on future external tables in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant select on all views in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;
grant select on future views in database "<your-database>" to role datahub_role;

// Create a new DataHub user and assign the DataHub role to it 
create user datahub_user display_name = 'DataHub' password='' default_role = datahub_role default_warehouse = '<your-warehouse>';

// Grant the datahub_role to the new DataHub user. 
grant role datahub_role to user datahub_user;
```

The details of each granted privilege can be viewed in [snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-privileges.html). A summarization of each privilege, and why it is required for this connector: 
- `operate` is required on warehouse to execute queries 
- `usage` is required for us to run queries using the warehouse
- `usage` on `database` and `schema` are required because without it tables and views inside them are not accessible. If an admin does the required grants on `table` but misses the grants on `schema` or the `database` in which the table/view exists then we will not be able to get metadata for the table/view.
- If metadata is required only on some schemas then you can grant the usage privilieges only on a particular schema like
```sql
grant usage on schema "<your-database>"."<your-schema>" to role datahub_role;
```
- To get the lineage and usage data we need access to the default `snowflake` database

This represents the bare minimum privileges required to extract databases, schemas, views, tables from Snowflake. 

If you plan to enable extraction of table lineage, via the `include_table_lineage` config flag, you'll need to grant additional privileges. See [snowflake usage prerequisites](#prerequisites-1) as the same privilege is required for this purpose too.


### Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, views and tables
- Column types associated with each table
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional [SQL profiling](./sql_profiles.md)
- Table lineage 
  - On Snowflake standard edition we can get
    - table -> view lineage
    - s3 -> table lineage
  - On Snowflake Enterprise edition in addition to the above from Snowflake Standard edition we can get (Please see [caveats](#caveats-1))
    - table -> table lineage
    - view -> table lineage

:::tip

You can also get fine-grained usage statistics for Snowflake using the `snowflake-usage` source described [below](#snowflake-usage-plugin).

### Caveats

The [caveats](#caveats-1) mentioned for `snowflake-usage` apply to `snowflake` too.

### Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: snowflake
  config:

    check_role_grants: True
    provision_role: # Optional
      enabled: false
      dry_run: true
      run_ingestion: false
      admin_username: "${SNOWFLAKE_ADMIN_USER}"
      admin_password: "${SNOWFLAKE_ADMIN_PASS}"

    # This option is recommended to be used for the first time to ingest all lineage
    ignore_start_time_lineage: true
    # This is an alternative option to specify the start_time for lineage
    # if you don't want to look back since beginning
    start_time: '2022-03-01T00:00:00Z'

    # Coordinates
    account_id: "abc48144"
    warehouse: "COMPUTE_WH"

    # Credentials
    username: "${SNOWFLAKE_USER}"
    password: "${SNOWFLAKE_PASS}"
    role: "datahub_role"

    # Change these as per your database names. Remove to all all databases
    database_pattern:
      allow:
      - "^ACCOUNTING_DB$"
      - "^MARKETING_DB$"
    schema_pattern:
      deny:
      - "information_schema.*"
    table_pattern:
      allow:
      # If you want to ingest only few tables with name revenue and sales
      - ".*revenue"
      - ".*sales"

    profiling:
      # Change to false to disable profiling
      enabled: true
    profile_pattern:
      allow:
        - 'ACCOUNTING_DB.*.*'
        - 'MARKETING_DB.*.*'

  # sink configs
```

### Config details

Like all SQL-based sources, the Snowflake integration supports:
- Stale Metadata Deletion: See [here](./stateful_ingestion.md) for more details on configuration.
- SQL Profiling: See [here](./sql_profiles.md) for more details on configuration.

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

## `snowflake-usage`

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

### Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[snowflake-usage]'`.

### Prerequisites 

In order to execute the `snowflake-usage` source, your Snowflake user will need to have specific privileges granted to it. Specifically, you'll need to grant access to the [Account Usage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html) system tables, using which the DataHub source extracts information. Assuming you've followed the steps outlined in `snowflake` plugin to create a DataHub-specific User & Role, you'll simply need to execute the following commands in Snowflake. This will require a user with the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role (or a role granted the IMPORT SHARES global privilege). Please see [Snowflake docs for more details](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-share-consumers.html).

```sql
grant imported privileges on database snowflake to role datahub_role;
```

### Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Statistics on queries issued and tables and columns accessed (excludes views)
- Aggregation of these statistics into buckets, by day or hour granularity


:::note

This source only does usage statistics. To get the tables, views, and schemas in your Snowflake warehouse, ingest using the `snowflake` source described above.

:::

### Caveats
- Some of the features are only available in the Snowflake Enterprise Edition. This docs has notes mentioning where this applies.
- The underlying Snowflake views that we use to get metadata have a [latency of 45 minutes to 3 hours](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html#differences-between-account-usage-and-information-schema). So we would not be able to get very recent metadata in some cases like queries you ran within that time period etc..
- If there is any [incident going on for Snowflake](https://status.snowflake.com/) we will not be able to get the metadata until that incident is resolved.

### Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: snowflake-usage
  config:
    # Coordinates
    account_id: account_name
    warehouse: "COMPUTE_WH"

    # Credentials
    username: "${SNOWFLAKE_USER}"
    password: "${SNOWFLAKE_PASS}"
    role: "datahub_role"

    # Options
    top_n_queries: 10
    email_domain: mycompany.com

    database_pattern:
      allow:
      - "^ACCOUNTING_DB$"
      - "^MARKETING_DB$"
    schema_pattern:
      deny:
      - "information_schema.*"

sink:
  # sink configs
```

### Config details

Snowflake integration also supports prevention of redundant reruns for the same data. See [here](./stateful_ingestion.md) for more details on configuration.

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.
