# DataHub GraphQL API

### DataHub provides a rich [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API for programmatically interacting with the Entities & Relationships comprising your organization's Metadata Graph

## Getting Started

Check out [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) to start using the DataHub GraphQL API right away. 

## About GraphQL 

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) provides a data query language and API with the following characteristics:

- A **validated specification**: The GraphQL spec verifies a *schema* on the API server. The server in turn is responsible
for validating incoming queries from the clients against that schema.
- **Strongly typed**: A GraphQL schema declares the universe of types and relationships composing the interface. 
- **Document-oriented & hierarchical**: GraphQL makes it eay to ask for related entities using a familiar JSON document
structure. This minimizes the number of round-trip API requests a client must make to answer a particular question.
- **Flexible & efficient**: GraphQL provides a way to ask for only the data you want, and that's it. Ignore all
the rest. It allows you to replace multiple REST calls with one GraphQL call.
- **Large Open Source Ecosystem**: Open source GraphQL projects have been developed for [virtually every programming language](https://graphql.org/code/). With a thriving
community, it offers a sturdy foundation to build upon. 
  
For these reasons among others DataHub provides a GraphQL API on top of the Metadata Graph,
permitting easy exploration of the Entities & Relationships composing it. 

For more information about the GraphQL specification, check out [Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/). 

## GraphQL Schema Reference

The Reference docs in the sidebar are generated from the DataHub GraphQL schema. Each call to the `/api/graphql` endpoint is
validated against this schema. You can use these docs to understand data that is available for retrieval and operations 
that may be performed using the API.

- Available Operations: [Queries](/graphql/queries.md) (Reads) & [Mutations](/graphql/mutations.md) (Writes)
- Schema Types: [Objects](/graphql/objects.md), [Input Objects](/graphql/inputObjects.md), [Interfaces](/graphql/interfaces.md), [Unions](/graphql/unions.md), [Enums](/graphql/enums.md), [Scalars](/graphql/scalars.md)

## On the Horizon

The GraphQL API undergoing continuous development. A few of the things we're most excited about can be found below.

### Supporting Additional Use Cases

DataHub plans to support the following use cases via the GraphQL API:

- **Creating entities**: Programmatically creating Datasets, Dashboards, Charts, Data Flows (Pipelines), Data Jobs (Tasks) and more.
- **Listing entities**: Listing all Metadata Entities of a particular type. 
- **Removing entities**: The ability to soft & hard delete Metadata Entities on DataHub.

This will enable organization's to build flows on top of DataHub for creating custom Metadata Entities,
extracting batch data from DataHub, and curating the Entities that are visible on the platform. 

### Client SDKs

DataHub plans to develop Open Source Client SDKs for Python, Java, Javascript among others on top of this API. If you're interested

### Token Based Authentication

Add universal token based authentication and get rid of the legacy `PLAY_SESSION` session cookie and `X-DataHub-Actor` used
for conveying actor identity information.
