### Slack Best Practices

Please keep in mind these Slack best-practices --

- **Make use of threads** for addressing specific questions/topics, and when posting large blocks of code - it helps us keep our channels and conversations organized
- **Avoid posting the same question in multiple channels** - if you’re having a tough time getting the support you need (or aren’t sure where to go!) please DM [@Maggie](https://datahubspace.slack.com/team/U0121TRV0FL) for support
