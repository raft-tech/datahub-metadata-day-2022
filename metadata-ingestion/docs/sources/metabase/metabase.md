Metabase databases will be mapped to a DataHub platform based on the engine listed in the
[api/database](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/api-documentation.html#database) response. This mapping can be
customized by using the `engine_platform_map` config option. For example, to map databases using the `athena` engine to
the underlying datasets in the `glue` platform, the following snippet can be used:
```yml
  engine_platform_map:
    athena: glue
```
DataHub will try to determine database name from Metabase [api/database](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/api-documentation.html#database)
payload. However, the name can be overridden from `database_alias_map` for a given database connected to Metabase.
