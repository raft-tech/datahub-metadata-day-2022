# Taking backup of DataHub

The recommended backup strategy is to periodically dump the database `datahub.metadata_aspect_v2` so it can be recreated from the dump which most managed DB services will support (e.g. AWS RDS). Then run [restore indices](./restore-indices.md) to recreate the indices. 

In order to back up Time Series Aspects (which power usage and dataset profiles), you'd have to do a backup of Elasticsearch, which is possible via AWS OpenSearch. Otherwise, you'd have to reingest dataset profiles from your sources in the event of a disaster scenario!
