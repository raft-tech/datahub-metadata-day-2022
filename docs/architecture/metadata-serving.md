# DataHub Serving Architecture

The figure below shows the high-level system diagram for DataHub's Serving Tier. 

![datahub-serving](../imgs/datahub-serving.png)

The primary service is called [gms](../../metadata-service) and exposes a REST API and a GraphQL API for performing CRUD operations on metadata. The metadata service also exposes search and graph query API-s to support secondary-index style queries, full-text search queries as well as relationship queries like lineage. In addition, the [datahub-frontend](../../datahub-frontend) service expose a GraphQL API on top of the metadata graph. 

## DataHub Serving Tier Components

### Metadata Storage

The DataHub Metadata Service (gms) persists metadata in a document store (could be an RDBMS like MySQL, Postgres or a key-value store like Couchbase etc.). 

### Metadata Commit Log Stream (MAE)

The DataHub Service Tier also emits a commit event [Metadata Audit Event (MAE)] when a metadata change has been successfully committed to persistent storage. This event is sent over Kafka. 

The MAE stream is a public API and can be subscribed to by external systems providing an extremely powerful way to react in real-time to changes happening in metadata. For example, you could build an access control enforcer that reacts to change in metadata (e.g. a previously world-readable dataset now has a pii field) to immediately lock down the dataset in question.
Note that not all MCE-s will result in an MAE, because the DataHub serving tier will ignore any duplicate changes to metadata.

### Metadata Index Applier (mae-consumer-job)

[MAE]-s are consumed by another Kafka Streams job, [mae-consumer-job], which applies the changes to the [graph] and [search index] accordingly. 
The job is entity-agnostic and will execute corresponding graph & search index builders, which will be invoked by the job when a specific metadata aspect is changed. 
The builder should instruct the job how to update the graph and search index based on the metadata change. 
The builder can optionally use [Remote DAO] to fetch additional metadata from other sources to help compute the final update.

To ensure that metadata changes are processed in the correct chronological order, MAEs are keyed by the entity [URN] â€” meaning all MAEs for a particular entity will be processed sequentially by a single Kafka streams thread. 

### Metadata Query Serving

Primary-key based reads (e.g. getting schema metadata for a dataset based on the `dataset-urn`) on metadata are routed to the document store. Secondary index based reads on metadata are routed to the search index (or alternately can use the strongly consistent secondary index support described [here]()). Full-text and advanced search queries are routed to the search index. Complex graph queries such as lineage are routed to the graph index.
