# SageMaker

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[sagemaker]'`.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Feature groups
- Models, jobs, and lineage between the two (e.g. when jobs output a model or a model is used by a job)

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: sagemaker
  config:
    # Coordinates
    aws_region: "my-aws-region"

sink:
  # sink configs
```
