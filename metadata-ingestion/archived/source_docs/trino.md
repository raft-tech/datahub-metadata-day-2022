# Trino

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[trino]'`.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, and tables
- Column types and schema associated with each table
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional [SQL profiling](./sql_profiles.md)

| Capability        | Status | Details                                  | 
|-------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| Data Containers   | ✔️     |                                          |
| Data Domains      | ✔️     | [link](../../docs/domains.md)            |

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: trino
  config:
    # Coordinates
    host_port: localhost:5300
    database: dbname

    # Credentials
    username: foo
    password: datahub

sink:
  # sink configs
```

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

As a SQL-based service, the Trino integration is also supported by our SQL profiler. See [here](./sql_profiles.md) for more details on configuration.

## Trino Usage Stats

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

### Starburst Trino Usage Stats
If you are using Starburst Trino you can collect usage stats the following way.
#### Prerequsities 
1. You need to setup Event Logger which saves audit logs into a Postgres db and setup this db as a catalog in Trino
Here you can find more info about how to setup:
https://docs.starburst.io/354-e/security/event-logger.html#security-event-logger--page-root
https://docs.starburst.io/354-e/security/event-logger.html#analyzing-the-event-log

2. Install starbust-trino-usage plugin 
Run pip install 'acryl-datahub[starburst-trino-usage]'.

#### Usage stats ingestion job
Here is a sample recipe to ingest usage data:
```
source:
    type: starburst-trino-usage
    config:
    # Coordinates
    host_port: yourtrinohost:port
    # The name of the catalog from getting the usage 
    database: hive
    # Credentials
    username: trino_username
    password: trino_password
    email_domain: test.com
    audit_catalog: audit
    audit_schema: audit_schema

sink:
    type: "datahub-rest"
    config:
        server: "http://localhost:8080"
```
### Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

By default, we extract usage stats for the last day, with the recommendation that this source is executed every day.
