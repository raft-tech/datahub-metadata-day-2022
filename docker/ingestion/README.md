# DataHub Ingestion Quickstart

Ingests some [sample data](../../metadata-ingestion/examples/mce_files/bootstrap_mce.json) into [GMA](../../docs/what/gma.md) using the [Python ingestion framework](../../metadata-ingestion). Recommended for use with [quickstart](../../docs/quickstart.md) to quickly get a DataHub instance up and running with some fake data.
