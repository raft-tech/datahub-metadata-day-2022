# ClickHouse

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[clickhouse]'`.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for tables, views, materialized views and dictionaries
- Column types associated with each table(except *AggregateFunction and DateTime with timezone)
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional [SQL profiling](./sql_profiles.md)
- Table, view, materialized view and dictionary(with CLICKHOUSE source_type) lineage

:::tip

You can also get fine-grained usage statistics for ClickHouse using the `clickhouse-usage` source described below.

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: clickhouse
  config:
    # Coordinates
    host_port: localhost:9000

    # Credentials
    username: user
    password: pass

    # Options
    platform_instance: DatabaseNameToBeIngested

    include_views: True # whether to include views, defaults to True
    include_tables: True # whether to include views, defaults to True

sink:
  # sink configs
```

<details>
  <summary>Extra options to use encryption connection or different interface</summary>

For the HTTP interface:
```yml
source:
  type: clickhouse
  config:
    host_port: localhost:8443
    protocol: https

```

For the Native interface:
```yml
source:
  type: clickhouse
  config:
    host_port: localhost:9440
    scheme: clickhouse+native
    secure: True
```

</details>

## Config details

Like all SQL-based sources, the ClickHouse integration supports:
- Stale Metadata Deletion: See [here](./stateful_ingestion.md) for more details on configuration.
- SQL Profiling: See [here](./sql_profiles.md) for more details on configuration.

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

# ClickHouse Usage Stats

This plugin extracts usage statistics for datasets in ClickHouse. For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

Note: Usage information is computed by querying the system.query_log table. In case you have a cluster or need to apply additional transformation/filters you can create a view and put to the `query_log_table` setting.

## Setup
To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[clickhouse-usage]'`.

## Capabilities
This plugin has the below functionalities -
1. For a specific dataset this plugin ingests the following statistics -
   1. top n queries.
   2. top users.
   3. usage of each column in the dataset.
2. Aggregation of these statistics into buckets, by day or hour granularity.

:::note

This source only does usage statistics. To get the tables, views, and schemas in your ClickHouse warehouse, ingest using the `clickhouse` source described above.

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: clickhouse-usage
  config:
    # Coordinates
    host_port: db_host:port
    platform_instance: dev_cluster
    email_domain: acryl.io

    # Credentials
    username: username
    password: "password"

sink:
# sink configs
```

## Config details
Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

By default, we extract usage stats for the last day, with the recommendation that this source is executed every day.
