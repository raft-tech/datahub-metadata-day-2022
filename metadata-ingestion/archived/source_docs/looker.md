# Looker dashboards

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[looker]'`.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Looker dashboards, dashboard elements (charts) and explores
- Names, descriptions, URLs, chart types, input explores for the charts
- Schemas and input views for explores
- Owners of dashboards

**_NOTE:_** To get complete Looker metadata integration (including Looker views and lineage to the underlying warehouse tables), you must ALSO use the LookML source. Documentation for that is [here](./lookml.md)

| Capability | Status | Details | 
| -----------| ------ | ---- |
| Platform Instance | üõë | [link](../../docs/platform-instances.md) |

## Configuration Notes

See the [Looker authentication docs](https://docs.looker.com/reference/api-and-integration/api-auth#authentication_with_an_sdk) for the steps to create a client ID and secret. 
You need to provide the following permissions for ingestion to work correctly. 
```
access_data
explore
manage_models
see_datagroups
see_lookml
see_lookml_dashboards
see_looks
see_pdts
see_queries
see_schedules
see_sql
see_system_activity
see_user_dashboards
see_users
```
Here is an example permission set after configuration.

## Quickstart recipe


Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: "looker"
  config:
    # Coordinates
    base_url: https://company.looker.com:19999

    # Credentials
    client_id: admin
    client_secret: password


sink:
  # sink configs
```

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.
