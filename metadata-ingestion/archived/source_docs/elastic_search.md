## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: "elasticsearch"
  config:
    # Coordinates
    host: 'localhost:9200'

    # Credentials
    username: user # optional
    password: pass # optional

    # Options
    url_prefix: "" # optional url_prefix
    env: "PROD"
    index_pattern:
      allow: [".*some_index_name_pattern*"]
      deny: [".*skip_index_name_pattern*"]

sink:
# sink configs
```

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.


| Field                       | Required | Default            | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------- |--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `host`                      | ✅       | `"localhost:9092"` | The elastic search host URI.                                  |
| `username`                  |          | None               | The username credential.                                      |

| `url_prefix`                |          | ""                 | There are cases where an enterprise would have multiple elastic search clusters. One way for them to manage is to have a single endpoint for all the elastic search clusters and use url_prefix for routing requests to different clusters.                            |
| `env`                       |          | `"PROD"`           | Environment to use in namespace when constructing URNs.       |

| `index_pattern.allow`       |          |                    | List of regex patterns for indexes to include in ingestion.   |
| `index_pattern.deny`        |          |                    | List of regex patterns for indexes to exclude from ingestion. |
| `index_pattern.ignoreCase`  |          | `True`             | Whether regex matching should ignore case or not              |
