- Charts, dashboards, and associated metadata

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: superset
  config:
    # Coordinates
    connect_uri: http://localhost:8088

    # Credentials
    username: user
    password: pass
    provider: ldap

sink:
  # sink configs
```

If you were using `database_alias` in one of your other ingestions to rename your databases to something else based on business needs you can rename them in superset also

```yml
source:
  type: superset
  config:
    # Coordinates
    connect_uri: http://localhost:8088

    # Credentials
    username: user
    password: pass
    provider: ldap
    database_alias:
      example_name_1: business_name_1
      example_name_2: business_name_2

sink:
  # sink configs
```
